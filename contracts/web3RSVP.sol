contract Web3RSVP {

    // Define an event: Let’s start by defining our smart contract and the information that we want to store on-chain: the creation of a new event by an event organizer and the details associated with that event. We’ll save this in a struct. As a refresher, a struct is similar to a JS object in that it stores related information about an entity. In our case, we’re storing information related to the creation of a new event on our RSVP contract. Recall that Solidity events are a way for our subgraph to listen for specific actions to enable us to make queries about the data from our smart contract. We have functions written to create a new event on our platform, RSVP to an event, confirm individual attendees, confirm the group of attendees, and send unclaimed funds back to the event owner. In order for our subgraph to be able to access the information from these functions, we need to expose them via events. We'll write the following events and emit them inside of their corresponding function:
    // NewEventCreated: exposes data about the new event like the owner, max capacity, event owner, deposit amount, etc.
    // NewRSVP: exposes data about the user who RSVP'd and the event they RSVP'd to
    // ConfirmedAttendee: exposes data about the user who was confirmed and the event that they were confirmed for
    // DepositsPaid: exposes data about unclaimed deposits being sent to the event organizer
    // All of our events are denoted by using the keyword event, followed by the custom name for our event.
    // Define your events at the very top of your file, inside the curly braces (right after contract Web3RSVP {):

    event NewEventCreated(
        bytes32 eventID,
        address creatorAddress,
        uint256 eventTimestamp,
        uint256 maxCapacity,
        uint256 deposit,
        string eventDataCID
    );

    event NewRSVP(bytes32 eventID, address attendeeAddress);

    event ConfirmedAttendee(bytes32 eventID, address attendeeAddress);

    event DepositsPaidOut(bytes32 eventID);

    // storing information related to the creation of a new event on our RSVP contract (these will be stored on-chain). In general, it’s wise to be picky about the data you store on-chain because it’s expensive to store data on Ethereum. Because of this, you’ll notice that we’re not storing details like the event’s name and event description directly in the struct, but instead we’re storing a reference to an IPFS hash where those details will be stored off-chain. More on this later, but for now just know that’s what eventDataCID is for!
    struct CreateEvent {
        bytes32 eventId;
        string eventDataCID;
        address eventOwner;

        uint256 deposit;
        uint256 maxCapacity;
        address[] confirmedRSVPs;
        address[] claimedRSVPs;
        bool paidOut;
    }

    // Because we want our contract to be able to handle the creation of multiple events, we need a mechanism to store and easily look up events by some identifier, like a unique ID. This is what we will use to tell our program which event a user is RSVPing to, since we can assume there will be many. To do this, we can create a Solidity mapping that maps, or defines a relationship with, a unique eventID to the struct we just defined that is associated with that event. We’ll use this mapping to make sure we are referencing the correct event when we call functions on that event like RSVPing, confirming attendees, etc. Inside of our contract and under our struct, we'll define this mapping.
    mapping(bytes32 => CreateEvent) public idToEvent;

    // the function that will get called when a user creates a new event in our frontend. This is one of our setter methods - a function that gets executed and sets the value based on information the user passed in. 'External' - We set the function visibility to external since it is highly performant and saves on gas.
    //     Next, we’ll write the function that will get called when a user creates a new event in our frontend. This is one of our setter methods - a function that gets executed and sets the value based on information the user passed in.
    // A reminder of what this function should be able to handle:
    // A unique ID
    // A reference to who created the event (a wallet address of the creator)
    // The time of the event, so we know when refunds should become available.

Finally we set the boolean paidOut to false because at the time of eventCreation, there have been no payouts to the RSVPers (there are none yet) or the event owner yet.

    // Now that we've defined them, we actually have to emit them somewhere. Defining events is adding them as a tool on your toolbelt, but emitting them is actually pulling that tool out and using it. Each event should be emitted where it makes sense, after a specific action has been taken.

    // For our first event, newEventCreated, we should emit this at the very end of our function createNewEvent.

    // To emit an event, we use the keyword emit and then pass in the arguments, AKA the actual values we want, based on the parameters we defined.

    // Emit NewEventCreated at the bottom of your createNewEvent function like this:

        emit NewEventCreated(
            eventId,
